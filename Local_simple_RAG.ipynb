Poultry and other  meats should always be cooked before eating.12  Vegetarian and Vegan Diets  Vegetarian and vegan diets have been followed for thousands of  years for different reasons, including as part of a spiritual practice,  to show respect for living things, for health reasons, or because of  environmental concerns. For many people, being a vegetarian is a  logical outgrowth of “thinking green.” A meat-based food system  requires more energy, land, and water resources than a plant-based  food system. This may suggest that the plant-based diet is more  sustainable than the average meat-based diet in the U.S.By avoiding  animal flesh, vegetarians hope to look after their own health and  that of the planet at the same time. Broadly speaking, vegetarians  eat beans, grains, and fruits and vegetables, and do not eat red  meat, poultry, seafood, or any other animal flesh. Some vegetarians,  known as lacto vegetarians, will eat dairy products. Others, known  as lacto-ovo vegetarians, will eat dairy products and eggs. A vegan  diet is the most restrictive vegetarian diet—vegans do not eat dairy,  eggs, or other animal products, and some do not eat honey.  Vegetarian diets have a number of benefits. Well-balanced eating  plans can lower the risk of a number of chronic conditions,  including heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. They also help to  promote sustainable agriculture. However, if a vegetarian does not  vary his or her food choices, the diet may be insufficient in calcium,  12.\\xa0Raw Food Diet. WebMD.com.https://www.webmd.com/ diet/a-z/raw-foods-diet.
